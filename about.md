# Purpose

We are a disc dog club. Our Purpose is to bring awareness to the community about the wonderful sport of Disc Dogging and how it can strengthen the bond between an owner and their dog. Flying Disc Dogs of Austin is a non-profit club where disc doggers of all levels can come together at local meet ups to play and learn this awesome sport. We promote the bond between human and dog through play, teamwork and trust! So, whether you're interested in competing, performing at demonstrations, or just want to have a fun way to get your dog's energy out, FDDA invites you to come on out to one of our meet ups and see what disc dogging is all about!
